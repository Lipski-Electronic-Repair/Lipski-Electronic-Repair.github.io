                <h3>Joseph:</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been opening and repairing computers since the age of 10.<br>
                    I have experience fixing desktop computer towers, all-in-one systems, laptops, and small servers.<br>
                    I am able to upgrade or exchange any component in a computer, as long as it is not soldered to the board.<br>
                    I'm proficient with Microsoft Windows, which allows me to diagnose and fix most software and driver issues.<br>
                    I also have the ability to repair cell phones, and I have been working on them for around three years.<br>
                    On top of that, I am also capable of fixing most video game systems, and I also have experience modding them.
                </p>
                <h3>Aidan:</h3>
                <p>
                    I started working on video game systems in mid-2019.<br>
                    Most of what I work on for game consoles are Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Playstation 4, and Nintendo Wii systems.<br>
                    I'm also able to fix game controllers, clean out and repaste game consoles to make them run quietly and cooler.<br>
                    I also have experience working with desktop computers, and I'm confidently able to repair most issues involving them.
